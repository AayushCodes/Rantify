# Rantify
Keeping yourself mentally healthy is the need of the hour. With pressure levels higher than ever, we need to have a place to express ourselves and vent it all out as and when we need to. “Ranting” has been scientifically proven to improve your mood and even improve efficiency. Music has been known, time and time again, to improve our mood and help us stay happy. Keeping in that same theme, we combined these two and created Rantify.

We aim to provide people with a platform where they can open up, relax and vent out their hectic lifestyles. By using these rants, we determine their current mental state and provide them with music playlists to help them loosen up and discover new music as well. We also provide them with blogs and article based on their mood so that they can connect more freely with what they are feeling.
